### Challenge

A tier two bank in the Midwest was experiencing a host of problems with their software release procedures. It took four days for 20,000 teller machines to receive the software releases. Each release was fraught with errors causing big headaches as well as time and money losses.

### Solution

We taught modern software methodologies to the bank's developers. Their 4-day software release procedure fraught with errors was turned into 4-hour software release procedure using automated testing and deployment. Cryptographic hashing techniques, which were somewhat revolutionary at the time, were used to ensure the integrity of software release process.
