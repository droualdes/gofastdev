### Challenge

A European automotive conglomerate processing big data was deploying error-prone software and taking 24 hours to do it. Individual developer productivity was in the tank with management frustrated and developers unsure what to do about it.

### Solution

We built them an automatic testing and deployment environment. We reduced the 24-hours processing down to 15-minutes. The error-prone software became full-tested software. Most importantly, we gave them an entirely repeatable way to develop software. Individual software developer productivity increased dramatically. We also made it easy to get developers into and out an incredibly complicated software development process.
