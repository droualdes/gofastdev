### Challenge

Tom Mornini founded a startup called Engine Yard, which hosted Rails applications for Fortune companies and startups. The customers were experiencing difficulties with deployment and scaling of Internet-facing Ruby on Rails applications. 

### Solution

Tom wrote a web administration interface that automated the deployment and scaling of Internet-facing Ruby on Rails applications. Tom and Engine Yard received a lot of industry recognition for solving an enormous problem with Rails. Company growth quickly hit 3,000 customers, and venture capital firms quickly took notice. Amazon, Benchmark, NEA Associates, and Oracles invested $90-million in total to date.

Today, Engine Yard is the largest hosting provider of Rails web applications. Groupon, Audi, MTV, Freshdesk, Bayer, and many other Fortune companies and startups host with them.
